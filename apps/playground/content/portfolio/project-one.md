# Nocturn — Brand Identity

Sleep brands tend to fall into two camps: either hyper-clinical (white coats, graphs, blue light filters) or aggressively cozy (clouds, sheep, pastel everything). Nocturn wanted to be neither. They make evidence-backed sleep products, but they also understand that bedtime is intimate, personal, and a little bit ritualistic.

The brief was simple: *make sleep feel like something you look forward to, not something you optimise.*

## Starting point

When we first spoke, the founders had a name, a handful of formulations, and a pitch deck full of competitor screenshots circled in red. They knew what they didn't want. That's actually a great place to start.

We spent two weeks in research — not just looking at sleep brands, but at hospitality, fragrance, and editorial design. The spaces where calm and craft overlap.

## The mark

The logomark is a crescent that doubles as a closing parenthesis. It came from a sketch on a Post-it note during our second working session and survived every round of refinement.

It works because it's simple enough to stamp on a tin lid, but distinctive enough to recognise at thumbnail size. No gradients, no tricks.

## Colour and type

The palette started with a constraint: no blue. Every sleep brand uses blue. Instead we went warm — a deep charcoal-plum for depth, a blush coral as the signature accent, and a cream that feels like good paper.

Fraunces was chosen for headlines because it has character without being loud. The soft serifs feel hand-touched, which reinforces the idea that these are crafted products, not factory output.

## In the wild

## What landed

The identity launched alongside their first product run. Within three months, organic social mentions doubled and their DTC conversion rate hit 4.2% — roughly 3x the category average. More importantly, people started calling the brand "beautiful" unprompted. That was the real win.
