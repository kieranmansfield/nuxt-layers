# Brand Identity Redesign

This project involved a complete overhaul of Acme Corp's brand identity, from logo design to comprehensive brand guidelines.

## Challenge

The client needed a modern, cohesive brand identity that would work across digital and print media while reflecting their innovative approach to technology.

## Approach

We started with extensive research and stakeholder interviews, then moved through iterative design phases:

1. **Discovery** — Brand audit and competitive analysis
2. **Strategy** — Positioning, voice, and visual direction
3. **Design** — Logo, color palette, typography system
4. **Guidelines** — Comprehensive brand book

## Results

The new identity increased brand recognition by 40% within the first quarter of launch.

> Design is not just what it looks like — design is how it works.
