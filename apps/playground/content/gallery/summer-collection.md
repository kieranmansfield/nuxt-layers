# Summer Collection

A curated set of photographs from the summer season, featuring coastal landscapes and modern architecture.

## About This Collection

These images were captured during a coastal photography trip, focusing on the interplay of natural light with both organic and built environments.

Each photograph explores different aspects of summer:

- **Landscapes** — Wide vistas and natural beauty
- **Architecture** — Modern structures against summer skies
- **Details** — Close-up textures and patterns
